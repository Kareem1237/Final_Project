For my final project, I used NLP (Natural Language Processing) and supervised machine learning to scrape, clean and build a model to evaluate whether an investment is risky depending on the news surrounding a company.
To do this, I have implemented the follwing steps:

1) Collect articles' URL and scrape their titles 

2) Clean the titles: removing symbols, punctuations, numbers

3) Tokenize and grammatical manipulation: Turn each title into a list and get the origin of each word.

4) Vectorize each title into an array : As this is text, I used vectorization to turn each sentence into a weighted list of words in a matrix.

5) Choose the best machine learning model and make predictions



(In the accompanying repository, you can access the python code and SQL codes.)

Enjoy!
